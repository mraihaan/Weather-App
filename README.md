# Weather-App
Created a weather app with Node & Express by using the OpenWeatherMap API. Users can search by city & country to get back the appropriate weather.

EDIT: As part of teaching myself how Docker works, I've containerized this application and deployed it on the cloud using Google Cloud Run (URL is in the 'About' section).
